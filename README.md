PracticalMLCourseProjRepo
=========================

This repo contains the files for the Johns Hopkins Practical Machine Learning course project

Notes to graders:

1) My code has helper functions and a script function, but knitr would not stitch the Rmd file where code in one chunk calls a FUNCTION in a different chunk.
2) So, I had to insert the code as text (three back ticks without the {r} tag).  
3) All R code is in the main Rmd file at the bottom.
4) I manually inserted the PNG plot files since the R plotting code couldn't be inserted via knitr.
5) To make it easier on you, I added a PDF file for the project write-up:-)  Click on View Raw and you will be prompted to view in Adobe Acrobat Reader.
6) I also added PDF file which contains the test script's output with the plots manually inserted.

So, the course project write-up file can be viewed via either:

- ProjectWriteUpCodeAsText.Rmd
- ProjectWriteUpCodeAsText.html
- ProjectWriteUpCodeAsText.pdf
 
And the output of my test script can be viewed in either:
- ProjectWriteUpCodeAsText.Rmd (as snippets)
- ProjectWriteUpCodeAsText.html (as snippets)
- ProjectWriteUpCodeAsText.pdf (as snippets)
- TestScriptOutput.pdf (uninterrupted sequence of printed output w/plots manually inserted)
 
I apologize for these complications.  I wish I had known that knitr didn't like function calling between code chunks before I wrote and tested my code:-(

Thank you for taking the time to review my course project materials!
